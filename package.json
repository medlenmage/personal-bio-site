I was born and raised in the Middle Tennessee area. Lived here all of my life and have loved it here.         I currently work for Metro Nashville Goverment in the Public Works department. I drive and operate various equipment but, mostly a tractor mower from spring to fall.         I want to get into development mostly for a career change. My current change is still pretty physicall intensive and, has alot of of stresses that come with working for a goverment department.         What i love about devlopment is multiple things. I've alway loved playing with technology and this gives a avenue to continue learning and devloping in the technological world.         I also love how creative it can be. From designing the webpage to discovering diffirent ways to apply code to websites and achieve the same or diffirent results.        </p>     </div>",
